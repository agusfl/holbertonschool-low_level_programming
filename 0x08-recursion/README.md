Learning objectives:

* What is recursion
* How to implement recursion
* In what situations you should implement recursion
* In what situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion

## Environment

* Language: C and Bash scripts
* Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Style guidelines: [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)
* Compiler: gcc 
 > **Note:** The code will be compiled using the options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
