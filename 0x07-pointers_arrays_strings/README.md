# Even more pointers, arrays and strings

Learning objectives:

* What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
* What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
* What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

## Environment

* Language: C and Bash scripts
* Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Style guidelines: [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)
* Compiler: gcc 
 > **Note:** The code will be compiled using the options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
