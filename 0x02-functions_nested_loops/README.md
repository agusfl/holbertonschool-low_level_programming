# Variables - if - else - while

Learning objectives:

* What are nested loops and how to use them
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
* What are header files and how to to use them with #include

## Environment

* Language: C and Bash scripts
* Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Style guidelines: [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)
