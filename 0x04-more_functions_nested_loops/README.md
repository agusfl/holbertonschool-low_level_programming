# More functions - nested loops

Learning objectives:

* What are nested loops and how to use them
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
* What are header files and how to to use them with #include

## Environment

* Language: C and Bash scripts
* Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Style guidelines: [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)
* Compiler: gcc 
 > **Note:** The code will be compiled using the options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

 |:----------------|:-------------------------------:|
 |main.h | prototypes of functions and libraries used.
 |0-isupper.c |Checks for uppercase character.
 |1-isdigit.c |Checks for a digit (0 through 9).
 |2-mul.c |Functions that multiplies two integers.
 |3-print_numebers.c |Function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9.
 |4-print_most_numbers.c |Prints numbers from 0 to 9 except for 2 and 4.
